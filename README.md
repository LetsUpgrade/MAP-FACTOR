>## ✍&nbsp; PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Maps application is an application where you can set up *appointments geographically.

*[Describe the project the best you can. Give any background information or link to resources that are necessary to understand the problem it is intended to solve. The more you elaborate on your idea, the easier it is to accomplish.]*

It could also be a plugin of some mayor app, it would be cool if it notified you 30 minutes before the appointment plus ETA, (so if the app knows that where you are from it takes 1 hour to arrive, it will notify you 1h30 minutes before)
